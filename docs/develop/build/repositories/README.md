# HaikuPorts build-packages repository

The `build/jam/repositories/HaikuPorts` directory contains
RemotePackageRepository files which detail packages and
repositories leveraged during Haiku's build process.

> Warning: The URL packages are obtained from
> are determined by the sha256sum of the repository
> file.

## Updating

Each RemotePackageRepository jam file in this directory
is processed by src/tools/hardlink_packages.py on the
HaikuPorts package server.

1) Latest RemotePackageRepository jam file in git is downloaded on package server.
2) Packages are added to HaikuPorts by automatic or manual means.
3) hardlink_packages is provided all the relevant directories and RemotePackageRepository file
4) hardlink_packages performs additional modification of the RemotePackageRepository and creates
   build repositories (https://eu.hpkg.haiku-os.org/haikuports/master/build-packages/)
5) The modified RemotePackageRepository file is copied back to the developers system and checked in to git.

## Container Process

Here is the fastest way to update this as of today.
Improvements are needed. Replace (ARCH) with architecture, (USER) with your non-root user.

## Prepare the build-packages repository

as root on limerick.ams3.haiku-os.org...

1) wget https://git.haiku-os.org/haiku/plain/build/jam/repositories/HaikuPorts/(ARCH) -O /var/lib/docker/volumes/ci_data_master_(ARCH)/_data/(ARCH)
2) Enter the buildmaster container:
   docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep ci_buildmaster_master_(ARCH) | awk '{ print $1 }') /bin/bash -l
3) apt update; apt install -y vim python3 python3-pkg-resources
4) edit the repository define, add the needed packages, _devel packages, and add base package to source section.
5) ln -s /var/buildmaster/package_tools/package_repo /usr/bin/package_repo
6) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/var/buildmaster/package_tools
7) ./package_tools/hardlink_packages.py (ARCH) ./(ARCH) /var/packages/repository/master/(ARCH)/current/packages/ /var/packages/build-packages/master/
8) exit; cp /var/lib/docker/volumes/ci_data_master_(ARCH)/_data/(ARCH) /home/(USER)/(ARCH); chown (USER) /home/(USER)/(ARCH);

## Pull the repostory file and commit it

From your local system...

1) scp -P2222 (USER)@limerick.ams3.haiku-os.org:./(ARCH) ./(ARCH)
2) commit the updated repostory define *without modifying it* in any way
